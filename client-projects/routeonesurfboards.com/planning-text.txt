I'd like to get any assets you have in vector format as an .ai or .eps: any logos, icons, board artwork, etc. like the route 1 sign on the ham and cheese, the air filter mask image and the logo text.

For the first week, I'm going to get as much as possible quickly laid out in wireframe, make some font choices, and get that to you next weekend/early next week (it's Superbowl Sunday, y'know) for input. I'll stick to black/white/gray like stance.com. 

After you have a chance to look at it, I'll add color accents and design details in sparingly where they make sense. Then throw it back for another review and start building. 

It should be ready to go by the end of February. $400, payable whenever in whatever installments work.

How does that sound?
